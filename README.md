<!-- I'm Shayan Shabihi, now a senior student in CE at the University of Tehran (UT). I've so far had a very pleasing time during my undergraduate studies, and am currently seeking more opportunities to grow and influence my community. -->

I'm Shayan Shabihi, a PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park Department of Computer Science. I previously graduated from the University of Tehran with my undergraduate degree in computer engineering. 
I have years of experience doing research in different areas of deep learning, blockchains, and security/privacy of computer systems, and now work in the intersection of deep learning and security/privacy, developing DL systems with better security guarantees.
